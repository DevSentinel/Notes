## Water Test Notes
4 Benefits of water:
- Drinking
- Swimming
- Transportation
- Hygeine

4 potential dangers of water:
- Floods
- Avalanches
- Drowning
- Source for diseases

Neutral (Good and Bad depending on the situation)
- Floods
- Drink Water (Too Much)

Vocab Words:
- Salinity is **the dissolved salt content of a body of water**
- Wells are long hollow shafts
- This underground freshwater reservoir is called an aquifer. (Stores fresh water)
- An ice sheet is a particularly large glacier that covers the land.
- A watershed is an area of land where all the water eventually drains into one main water body, such as a stream, river, wetland, lake, or ocean.
- About one third of the worlds fresh water is underground. (We call it Groundwater Zone)
- Transpiration is the process of water evaporation from plant leaves, and animals exhale water vapour during respiration.
- Respiration rate is the number of breaths a person takes per minute.

What are the 3 states of Water?
- Liquid, Solid, and Gas - Constantly changing from one state to another in a never ending cycle.
- Liquid Water is found both above and below the ground.

What percent of all water is saltwater? Where is it found? What percent of all water is freshwater? Where is it found?
- Salt water fills the worlds oceans and makes up 97 percent of the water on the planet.
- Fresh water. the only water we can drink is only about 3% of earths water supply.

How much of Canada’s Freshwater is located underground? How does it get there? How do we access it?
- About one third of the worlds fresh water is underground. (We call it Groundwater)
- As rainwater falls, it soaks into the soil and flows down between the soil particles. Slowly it continues draining downward through more soil and rocks until it reaches a layer that is diffucult to pass through. The area where "vater fills all the air spaces in the soil and in the tiny cracks in the rock is called the groundwater zone.
- This underground freshwater reservoir is called an aquifer. Most rural homes and small farms drill w ells (long, hollow shafts) down into aquifers to obtain fresh water.

All of this human activity has caused high levels of pollution in the riv r over the past century. il spills and the
dumping of chemical waste by industries are two major sources
of this contamination.
One victim of the river's pollution is the beluga v,rhale
(Figure 10.3). Studies have found high levels of toxins in the
bodies of these whales.

All the human activity in the St. Lawrence River has caused high leels of pollution in the river over the past century. Oil spills and the dumping of chemical waste by industries are two major sources. One victim of the rivers pollution is the beuga whale. Studies have found high levels of toxins in the bodies of these whales.
